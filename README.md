#README

This library was intended as a Fan Control from the RPi3. It is very experimental so results may vary dependent on configuration.

However, I think it is reasonable to assume that this controller will function well with an installation of the correct RPi3 (version XXX)  and the designation of the correct position of the python script in your ~/.bashrc

To run automatically add these lines to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc

#   ***automated fan regulation circuit*** 
python2.7  /home/pi/Desktop/Programs_and_Scripts/RPi3_temp_control/RPi3_temp_regulator.py  &
